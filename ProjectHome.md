# Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment (TREE) #

TREE is an IDA Pro plugin that combines both dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution to support interactive security analysis on binaries from multiple instruction sets and operating systems.

TREE and the back-end binary analysis engine CBASS(Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic execution System) are developed by Cyber Innovation Unit of Battelle Memorial Institute, based on research and development in the past few years.
